    "### Main Features\n",
    "- **Text Analysis:** Tokenize and analyze text, showing tokens, their shapes, parts of speech, tags, lemmas, and stopword status.\n",
    "- **Named Entity Recognition:** Extract and visualize entities such as names, dates, and organizations from the input text.\n",
    "- **TEI XML Generation:** Takes a document as a sequence of tokens as input and generates a downloadable Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) compliant XML document.\n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis:** Determine the sentiment of the input text, classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
    "- **Word Cloud Generation:** Create word clouds to visualize the most common words in the input text.\n",
    "- **Frequency Plots:** Generate bar plots to visualize the frequency of the most common tokens in the input text.\n",
    "- **Part of Speech Histograms:** Display histograms showing the distribution of different parts of speech in the input text.\n",
    "- **Interactive Maps:** Create interactive maps to visualize geographical entities extracted from the input text (optional).\n",

    "### 1. Why do we need a NLP-based scholarly digital edition of the letters of Vespasiano di Bisticci and how are we supposed to benefit from it?\n",
    "A Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based scholarly digital edition (SDE) of the letters of Vespasiano di Bisticci can provide several benefits:\n",
    "- **Enhanced Understanding:** NLP can help us understand the content of the letters in a more nuanced way. It can reveal patterns, themes, and sentiments that might not be immediately apparent from a casual reading. This can provide new insights into Vespasiano di Bisticci's thoughts, feelings, and experiences, as well as the broader historical and cultural context in which he lived [1,2].\n",
    "- **Efficient Analysis:** Analyzing historical texts manually can be a time-consuming process, especially when dealing with a large number of documents. NLP can automate much of this process, making it possible to analyze the letters more efficiently [3].\n",
    "- **Interactive Exploration:** The interactive features of the SDE, such as word clouds, frequency plots, and part-of-speech histograms, can provide a more engaging and immersive experience for users. They can explore the text in a dynamic way, generating visualizations based on their interests [4].\n",
    "- **Facilitating Research:** The NLP-based SDE can be a valuable resource for scholars studying Vespasiano di Bisticci, the Renaissance period, or historical linguistics. It can facilitate research by providing a rich, interactive, and easily accessible dataset for analysis [5].\n",

    "### 2. What do we need to create a NLP-based SDE and what kind of edition is best suited to our case?\n",
    "        \n",
    "Creating a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based scholarly digital edition (SDE) of the letters of Vespasiano di Bisticci involves several steps and considerations:\n",
    "- **Accurate Transcription and Translation:** The letters must be accurately transcribed and, if necessary, translated. This is a critical step as the quality of the NLP analysis depends on the quality of the input text [6]\n",
    "- **Selection of NLP Tools:** The choice of NLP tools depends on the specific tasks we want to perform (e.g., tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis). Python has several libraries for NLP, such as NLTK, SpaCy, and TextBlob, which can be used for these tasks [7].\n",
    "- **Development of the Web Application:** Streamlit is a great choice for developing interactive web applications for machine learning and data science. It allows you to create interactive features like word clouds, downloadable results in different formats such as CSV and XML, frequency plots, and part-of-speech histograms [8].\n",
    "- **Inclusion of Scholarly Input:** The NLP analysis should be complemented with scholarly input to provide context and interpretation. This could involve annotating the text with additional information or providing essays that discuss the findings of the NLP analysis [2].\n",

    "### 3. What's the significance of applying geospatial prototyping in literary studies and digital humanities?\n",
    "The use of geospatial prototyping in literary studies and digital humanities, can offer several benefits and opportunities for deeper analysis and understanding. This approach incorporates the use of digital tools to visually represent the geographical elements in a narrative or the wider landscape of literary works[9, 10].\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some reasons why mapping literature and geospatial prototyping are beneficial:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spatial Understanding:** Geospatial mapping can offer readers and researchers a new dimension of understanding, illuminating the significance of place and space in a work. Many literary works, for example, reference specific geographic locations, or their narratives are deeply influenced by the characteristics of the environments in which they are set. Seeing these settings visually can greatly enhance our understanding of these aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Contextualization:** Mapping can also provide additional context by linking narratives to their real-world locations. This could help to enrich a reader's understanding of historical, cultural, or socio-political contexts that influence the narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comparative Analysis:** Geospatial prototyping can facilitate comparative studies of different works by the same author, or different authors writing about the same place. Seeing these works in a geographical context can shed light on thematic similarities and differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pattern Recognition:** A visual representation can help identify patterns that might be less apparent when reading the text. This might include recurring themes related to specific locations, trends in the movement of characters, or the evolution of a place over time as depicted in a series of works.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessibility and Engagement:** Interactive maps can make literature more accessible and engaging, especially for audiences that might be less familiar with the geographic context of a work. It can also offer innovative ways for teaching literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interdisciplinary Research:** Finally, mapping literature can facilitate interdisciplinary research, bridging the gap between humanities and disciplines such as geography, urban studies, and sociology. This allows for richer and more diverse perspectives in studying literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Which technologies best archieve the expected results?\n",
