Nobilis vir devote nobis dilecte, through your letter dated December 2019, we understood with how much affection you advised us of fines and various news that it was very dear to us to know. As for the part you write about if a great effort should be made this year against those who have been disturbing the peace of Italy with the intention of giving them the law, we will reply that we hope in our Lord God and the connected states will use prudence to oppose them they wanted to do to others, they will suffer, and they will repent of their slight movements.
We have read the letters that you write to our Secretary of the great honor these magnificent citizens have given to our son , the Most Illustrious Duke of Calabria : of which singular pleasure we have received. Likewise, they liked the havisi ne fate of the progress of Hungary in which way they passed. And not least we like for the common good of the league what you say havere Nicodemo reported from Milan. We thank you for everything.
