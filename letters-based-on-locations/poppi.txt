I received, together with your letters, the Philippics of Cicero and the First Punic War and the History of Leonardi . I am now waiting for the Life of Charles and Emilius the Probus , and the same other books that I mentioned in my previous letters. For I desire, in this semester of my government, not only to carry out the office properly, as I must and as most people are wont to do, but also that many will, few can praise and <me>worthy of dying. But I fear lest the occupations of the court, and the many things which happen every day inimical to leisure and foreign to literature, should be opposed to this will of mine. However, the little time that I have left over from business and from these troubles, I would like to devote to writing and especially to reading. You, however, do not want me to have any means, but for your kindness in me you will take care that the other books I need may be brought to us as soon as possible. Goodbye
