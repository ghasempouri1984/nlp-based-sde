We understood what you wrote about it for one of yours dated 10th of the present, responding to another of ours dated 22nd of the past month. And as for that we write to you, so for this we affirm that, excluding for our associates from their side what we have in mind to execute us regarding the provisions to be made, the thing will easily come to what you write: that the opposite party perhaps ask for it and it would be dear to be understood, even as it is. We have the hope that each one will see to it that it will be useful and honorable for the common states of our league; and we, from our own side, will not cease to operate and effectively do everything that will be possible and that we will recognize to be useful and necessary.
As for the part of our Most Illustrious Firstborn , we have great pleasure in having the minds of these excellent Lords and men of this city satisfied, and we remain very much obliged to them by the honor that was done to the prefated Duke for those there .
Given in our city of Putheoli , January 15, 1468 .
